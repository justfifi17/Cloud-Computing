# ‚ò∏ Running App on Kubernetes ‚ò∏Ô∏èüê≥

#### * Running multi-node Kubernetes cluster on Cloud using a hosted Kubernetes cluster with Google Kubernetes Engine  - three nodes*
#




### Brief Introduction to the work 
This project involves running an application on Kubernetes using Google Cloud Platform (GCP). By setting up and managing a Kubernetes environment, I created a Kubernetes cluster, deployed the application, and exposed it to the internet.
#

### Design Overview 
‚óè  Deploy a simple application on Kubernetes using Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) in the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) environment. 

‚óè The application consists of a set of replicated pods managed by a Replication Controller (RC). 

‚óè A Service is exposed to provide external access to the application.

‚óè Uses YAML configuration files and the kubectl command-line tool enhancing the deployment process.

#


### In conclusion...
Together, Kubernetes and GCP offer a powerful platform for deploying and managing web applications, showing the versatility and efficiency of modern cloud-native technologies.

#


### How to Use
‚óè Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.

‚óè Follow the steps on the Google Slides linked at the buttom.  

‚óè Create the Replication Controller YAML file - "sudo vim kubia-rc.yaml"

‚óè Copy and paste the content from the "kubia-rc.yaml" file when creating the YAML file, then save and exit. 

‚óè Access the application via external IP address (curl http://<EXTERNAL_IP>:8080)
