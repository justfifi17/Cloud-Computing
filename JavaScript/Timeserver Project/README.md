# HTTP JSON API Node.js Time Server üïí

#### * A simple Node.js server app that handles HTTP requests and responds current time with JSON data*
#




### Brief Introduction to the work 
This project involves creating an HTTP server in Node.js that listens for requests on a specific route ('/api/currenttime'). When a request is received, the server will generate the current date and time and send it back to the client in a JSON format. This project creates a basic HTTP server in Node.js and handle JSON data.
#

### Design Overview 
‚óè  Using Node.js for accurate and efficient time data retrieval.

‚óè  Utilizing the HTTP protocol for client-server communication, ensuring broad compatibility and ease of integration.

‚óè  Adopting JSON for data exchange, leveraging its simplicity and efficiency in web environments.
#

### System Architecture - Based on a client-server model. 
‚óè The client (web browser) sends HTTP requests to the server

‚óè Node.js server processes the request 

‚óè Server responds with JSON current time data back to the client. 
#


### In conclusion...
This project demonstrates the power and flexibility of Node.js for creating lightweight and efficient web APIs.

#

### How to Use
‚óè Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.

‚óè Run node server.js to start the server.

‚óè Access endpoints via "http://localhost:8000/api/currenttime" and other provided endpoints for time data.
