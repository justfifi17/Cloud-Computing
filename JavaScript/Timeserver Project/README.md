## HTTP JSON API Node.js Time Server 
### Brief Introduction to the work 
This project involves creating an HTTP server in Node.js that listens for requests on a specific route ('/api/currenttime'). When a request is received, the server will generate the current date and time and send it back to the client in a JSON format. This project creates a basic HTTP server in Node.js and handle JSON data.
#

### Design Overview 
●  Using Node.js for accurate and efficient time data retrieval.

●  Utilizing the HTTP protocol for client-server communication, ensuring broad compatibility and ease of integration.

●  Adopting JSON for data exchange, leveraging its simplicity and efficiency in web environments.
#

### System Architecture - Based on a client-server model. 
● The client (web browser) sends HTTP requests to the server

● Node.js server processes the request 

● Server responds with JSON current time data back to the client. 
#


### In conclusion...
This project demonstrates the power and flexibility of Node.js for creating lightweight and efficient web APIs.
